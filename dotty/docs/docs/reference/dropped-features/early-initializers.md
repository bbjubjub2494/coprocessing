title: Dropped: Early Initializers

Early initializers of the form
```scala
class C extends { ... } with SuperClass ...
```
have been dropped. They were rarely used, and mostly to compensate for the lack of
[trait parameters](../other-new-features/trait-parameters.md), which are now directly supported in Dotty.
