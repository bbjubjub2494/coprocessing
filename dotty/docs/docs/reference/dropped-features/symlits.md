title: Dropped: Symbol Literals
---

Symbol literals are no longer supported. The `scala.Symbol` class still exists, so a
literal translation of the symbol literal `'xyz` is `Symbol("xyz")`. However, it is recommended to use a plain string literal `"xyz"` instead. (The `Symbol` class will be deprecated and removed in the future).
