title: "Changes in Implicit Resolution"
---

Implicit resolution uses a new algorithm which caches implicit results
more aggressively for performance. There are also some changes that
affect implicits on the language level.

 1. Types of implicit values and result types of implicit methods
    must be explicitly declared. Excepted are only values in local blocks
    where the type may still be inferred:
    ```scala
    class C {

      val ctx: Context = ...        // ok

      /*!*/ implicit val x = ...    // error: type must be given explicitly

      /*!*/ implicit def y = ...    // error: type must be given explicitly

      val y = {
        implicit val ctx = this.ctx // ok
        ...
      }
    ```
 2. Nesting is now taken into account for selecting an implicit.
    Consider for instance the following scenario:
    ```scala
    def f(implicit i: C) = {
      def g(implicit j: C) = {
        implicitly[C]
      }
    }
    ```
    This will now resolve the `implicitly` call to `j`, because `j` is nested
    more deeply than `i`. Previously, this would have resulted in an
    ambiguity error. The previous possibility of an implicit search failure
    due to _shadowing_ (where an implicit is hidden by a nested definition)
    no longer applies.

 3. Package prefixes no longer contribute to the implicit scope of a type.
    Example:
    ```scala
    package p
    given a as A

    object o {
      given b as B
      type C
    }
    ```
    Both `a` and `b` are visible as implicits at the point of the definition
    of `type C`. However, a reference to `p.o.C` outside of package `p` will
    have only `b` in its implicit scope but not `a`.

 4. The treatment of ambiguity errors has changed. If an ambiguity is encountered
    in some recursive step of an implicit search, the ambiguity is propagated to the caller.
    Example: Say you have the following definitions:
    ```scala
    class A
    class B extends C
    class C
    implicit def a1: A
    implicit def a2: A
    implicit def b(implicit a: A): B
    implicit def c: C
    ```
    and the query `implicitly[C]`.

    This query would now be classified as ambiguous. This makes sense, after all
    there are two possible solutions, `b(a1)` and `b(a2)`, neither of which is better
    than the other and both of which are better than the third solution, `c`.
    By contrast, Scala 2 would have rejected the search for `A` as
    ambiguous, and subsequently have classified the query `b(implicitly[A])` as a normal fail,
    which means that the alternative `c` would be chosen as solution!

    Scala 2's somewhat puzzling behavior with respect to ambiguity has been exploited to implement
    the analogue of a "negated" search in implicit resolution, where a query `Q1` fails if some
    other query `Q2` succeeds and `Q1` succeeds if `Q2` fails. With the new cleaned up behavior
    these techniques no longer work. But there is now a new special type `scala.implicits.Not`
    which implements negation directly. For any query type `Q`: `Not[Q]` succeeds if and only if
    the implicit search for `Q` fails.

 5. The treatment of divergence errors has also changed. A divergent implicit is
    treated as a normal failure, after which alternatives are still tried. This also makes
    sense: Encountering a divergent implicit means that we assume that no finite
    solution can be found on the given path, but another path can still be tried. By contrast
    most (but not all) divergence errors in Scala 2 would terminate the implicit
    search as a whole.

 6. Scala-2 gives a lower level of priority to implicit conversions with call-by-name
    parameters relative to implicit conversions with call-by-value parameters. Dotty
    drops this distinction. So the following code snippet would be ambiguous in Dotty:
    ```scala
    implicit def conv1(x: Int): A = new A(x)
    implicit def conv2(x: => Int): A = new A(x)
    def buzz(y: A) = ???
    buzz(1)   // error: ambiguous
    ```
 7. The rule for picking a _most specific_ alternative among a set of overloaded or implicit
    alternatives is refined to take context parameters into account. All else
    being equal, an alternative that takes some context parameters is taken to be less specific
    than an alternative that takes none. If both alternatives take context parameters, we try
    to choose between them as if they were methods with regular parameters.
    The following paragraph in the SLS is affected by this change:

    _Original version:_

    > An alternative A is _more specific_ than an alternative B if the relative weight of A over B is greater than the relative weight of B over A.

    _Modified version:_

    An alternative A is _more specific_ than an alternative B if

     - the relative weight of A over B is greater than the relative weight of B over A, or
     - the relative weights are the same, and A takes no implicit parameters but B does, or
     - the relative weights are the same, both A and B take implicit parameters, and
       A is more specific than B if all implicit parameters in either alternative are
       replaced by regular parameters.
