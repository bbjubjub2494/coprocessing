title: threadUnsafe annotation
---

A new annotation `@threadUnsafe` can be used on a field which defines a `lazy
val`. When this annotation is used, the initialization of the lazy val will use a
faster mechanism which is not thread-safe.

### Example

```scala
import scala.annotation.threadUnsafe

class Hello {
  @threadUnsafe lazy val x: Int = 1
}
```
