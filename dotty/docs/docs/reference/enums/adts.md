title: "Algebraic Data Types"
---

The [`enum` concept](./enums.html) is general enough to also support algebraic data
types (ADTs) and their generalized version (GADTs). Here is an example
how an `Option` type can be represented as an ADT:

```scala
enum Option[+T] {
  case Some(x: T)
  case None
}
```

This example introduces an `Option` enum with a covariant type
parameter `T` consisting of two cases, `Some` and `None`. `Some` is
parameterized with a value parameter `x`. It is a shorthand for writing a
case class that extends `Option`. Since `None` is not parameterized, it
is treated as a normal enum value.

The `extends` clauses that were omitted in the example above can also
be given explicitly:

```scala
enum Option[+T] {
  case Some(x: T) extends Option[T]
  case None       extends Option[Nothing]
}
```

Note that the parent type of the `None` value is inferred as
`Option[Nothing]`. Generally, all covariant type parameters of the enum
class are minimized in a compiler-generated extends clause whereas all
contravariant type parameters are maximized. If `Option` was non-variant,
you would need to give the extends clause of `None` explicitly.

As for normal enum values, the cases of an `enum` are all defined in
the `enum`s companion object. So it's `Option.Some` and `Option.None`
unless the definitions are "pulled out" with an import:

```scala
scala> Option.Some("hello")
val res1: t2.Option[String] = Some(hello)

scala> Option.None
val res2: t2.Option[Nothing] = None
```

Note that the type of the expressions above is always `Option`. That
is, the implementation case classes are not visible in the result
types of their `apply` methods. This is a subtle difference with
respect to normal case classes. The classes making up the cases do
exist, and can be unveiled by constructing them directly with a `new`.

```scala
scala> new Option.Some(2)
val res3: t2.Option.Some[Int] = Some(2)
```

As all other enums, ADTs can define methods. For instance, here is `Option` again, with an
`isDefined` method and an `Option(...)` constructor in its companion object.

```scala
enum Option[+T] {
  case Some(x: T)
  case None

  def isDefined: Boolean = this match {
    case None => false
    case some => true
  }
}
object Option {
  def apply[T >: Null](x: T): Option[T] =
    if (x == null) None else Some(x)
}
```

Enumerations and ADTs have been presented as two different
concepts. But since they share the same syntactic construct, they can
be seen simply as two ends of a spectrum and it is perfectly possible
to construct hybrids. For instance, the code below gives an
implementation of `Color` either with three enum values or with a
parameterized case that takes an RGB value.

```scala
enum Color(val rgb: Int) {
  case Red   extends Color(0xFF0000)
  case Green extends Color(0x00FF00)
  case Blue  extends Color(0x0000FF)
  case Mix(mix: Int) extends Color(mix)
}
```

### Syntax of Enums

Changes to the syntax fall in two categories: enum definitions and cases inside enums.
The changes are specified below as deltas with respect to the Scala syntax given [here](../../internals/syntax.md)

 1. Enum definitions are defined as follows:
    ```
    TmplDef   ::=  `enum' EnumDef
    EnumDef   ::=  id ClassConstr [`extends' [ConstrApps]] EnumBody
    EnumBody  ::=  [nl] ‘{’ [SelfType] EnumStat {semi EnumStat} ‘}’
    EnumStat  ::=  TemplateStat
                |  {Annotation [nl]} {Modifier} EnumCase
    ```
 2. Cases of enums are defined as follows:
    ```
    EnumCase  ::=  `case' (id ClassConstr [`extends' ConstrApps]] | ids)
    ```
