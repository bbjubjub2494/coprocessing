title: "Implementing Typeclasses"
---

A _typeclass_ is an abstract, parameterized type that lets you add new behavior to any closed data type without using sub-typing. This can be useful in multiple use-cases, for example:
* expressing how a type you don't own (from the standard or 3rd-party library) conforms to such behavior
* expressing such a behavior for multiple types without involving sub-typing relationships (one `extends` another) between those types (see: [ad hoc polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism) for instance) 

Therefore in Scala 3, _typeclasses_ are just _traits_ with one or more parameters whose implementations are not defined through the `extends` keyword, but by **given instances**. 
Here are some examples of usual typeclasses:

### Semigroups and monoids:

Here's the `Monoid` typeclass definition:

```scala
trait SemiGroup[T] {
  def (x: T) combine (y: T): T
}

trait Monoid[T] extends SemiGroup[T] {
  def unit: T
}
```

An implementation of this `Monoid` typeclass for the type `String` can be the following: 

```scala
given Monoid[String] {
  def (x: String) combine (y: String): String = x.concat(y)
  def unit: String = ""
}
```

Whereas for the type `Int` one could write the following:
```scala
given Monoid[Int] {
  def (x: Int) combine (y: Int): Int = x + y
  def unit: Int = 0
}
```

This monoid can now be used as _context bound_ in the following `combineAll` method:

```scala
def combineAll[T: Monoid](xs: List[T]): T =
    xs.foldLeft(summon[Monoid[T]].unit)(_ combine _)
```

To get rid of the `summon[...]` we can define a `Monoid` object as follows:

```scala
object Monoid {
  def apply[T](using m: Monoid[T]) = m
}
```

Which would allow to re-write the `combineAll` method this way: 

```scala
def combineAll[T: Monoid](xs: List[T]): T =
    xs.foldLeft(Monoid[T].unit)(_ combine _)
```

We can also benefit from [extension methods](extension-methods-new.html) to make this `combineAll` function accessible as a method on the `List` type:


```scala
def [T: Monoid](xs: List[T]).combineAll: T =
  xs.foldLeft(Monoid[T].unit)(_ combine _)  
```

Which allows one to write: 

```scala
assert("ab" == List("a", "b").combineAll)
```
or:
```scala
assert(3 == List(1, 2).combineAll)
```

### Functors:

A `Functor` for a type provides the ability for its values to be "mapped over", i.e. apply a function that transforms inside a value while remembering its shape. For example, to modify every element of a collection without dropping or adding elements.
We can represent all types that can be "mapped over" with `F`. It's a type constructor: the type of its values becomes concrete when provided a type argument.
Therefore we write it `F[?]`, hinting that it is a type with internal details we can inspect.
The definition of a generic `Functor` would thus be written as:

```scala
trait Functor[F[?]] {
  def map[A, B](original: F[A], mapper: A => B): F[B]
}
```

Which could read as follows: "A `Functor` for the type constructor `F[?]` represents the ability to transform `F[A]` to `F[B]` through the application of the `mapper` function whose type is `A => B`". We call the `Functor` definition here a _typeclass_.
This way, we could define an instance of `Functor` for the `List` type: 

```scala
given Functor[List] {
  def map[A, B](original: List[A], mapper: A => B): List[B] =
    original.map(mapper) // List already has a `map` method
}
```

With this `given` instance in scope, everywhere a `Functor` is expected, the compiler will accept a `List` to be used.

For instance, we may write such a testing method:
```scala
def assertTransformation[F[?]: Functor, A, B](expected: F[B], original: F[A], mapping: A => B): Unit =
  assert(expected == summon[Functor[F]].map(original, mapping))
```

And use it this way, for example:

```scala
assertTransformation(List("a1", "b1"), List("a", "b"), elt => s"${elt}1")
```

That's a first step, but in practice we probably would like the `map` function to be a method directly accessible on the type `F`. So that we can call `map` directly on instances of `F`, and get rid of the `summon[Functor[F]]` part.
As in the previous example of Monoids, [`extension` methods](extension-methods-new.html) help achieving that. Let's re-define the `Functor` _typeclass_ with extension methods.

```scala
trait Functor[F[?]] {
  def [A, B](original: F[A]).map(mapper: A => B): F[B]
}
```

The instance of `Functor` for `List` now becomes:

```scala
given Functor[List] {
  def [A, B](original: List[A]).map(mapper: A => B): List[B] =
    original.map(mapper) // List already has a `map` method
}
```

It simplifies the `assertTransformation` method:

```scala
def assertTransformation[F[?]: Functor, A, B](expected: F[B], original: F[A], mapping: A => B): Unit =
  assert(expected == original.map(mapping))
```

The `map` method is now directly used on `original` since it is of type `F[A]` (where `F` is a `Functor`).


### Monads

Now we have a `Functor` for `List`.

Applying the `List.map` ability with the following mapping function as parameter: `mapping: A => B` would result in a `List[B]`.

Now, applying the `List.map` ability with the following mapping function as parameter: `mapping: A => List[B]` would result in a `List[List[B]]`.  

To avoid avoid managing lists of lists, we may want to "flatten" the values in a single list.

That's where `Monad` enters the party. A `Monad` for type `F[?]` is a `Functor[F]` with 2 more abilities: 
* the flatten ability we just described: turning `F[A]` to `F[B]` when given a `mapping: A => F[B]` function
* the ability to create `F[A]` from a single value `A`

Here is the translation of this definition in Scala 3:

```scala
trait Monad[F[?]] extends Functor[F] { // "A `Monad` for type `F[?]` is a `Functor[F]`" => thus has the `map` ability
  def pure[A](x: A): F[A] // `pure` can construct F[A] from a single value A
  def [A, B](x: F[A]).flatMap(f: A => F[B]): F[B] // the flattening ability is named `flatMap`, using extension methods as previous examples
  def [A, B](x: F[A]).map(f: A => B) = x.flatMap(f `andThen` pure) // the `map(f)` ability is simply a combination of applying `f` then turning the result into an `F[A]` then applying `flatMap` to it
}
```

#### List

Let us declare the `Monad` ability for type `List`  
```scala
given listMonad as Monad[List] {
  def pure[A](x: A): List[A] =
    List(x)
  def [A, B](xs: List[A]).flatMap(f: A => List[B]): List[B] =
    xs.flatMap(f) // let's rely on the existing `flatMap` method of `List`
}
```

`map` implementation is no longer needed.

#### Option

`Option` is an other type having the same kind of behaviour:
* the `map` ability turning `Option[A]` into `Option[B]` if passed a function `f: A => B`
* the `flatMap` ability turning `Option[A]` into `Option[B]` if passed a function `f: A => Option[B]`
* the `pure` ability turning `A` into `Option[A]`

```scala
given optionMonad as Monad[Option] {
  def pure[A](x: A): Option[A] =
    Option(x)
  def [A, B](xs: Option[A]).flatMap(f: A => Option[B]): Option[B] =
    xs.flatMap(f) // let's rely on the existing `flatMap` method of `Option`
}
```

#### The Reader Monad

Another example of a `Monad` is the Reader Monad. It no longer acts on a type like `List` or `Option`, but on a function.
It can be used for example for combining functions that all need the same type of parameter. For instance multiple functions needing access to some configuration, context, environment variables, etc.

Let us have a `Config` type, and two functions using it:

```scala
trait Config
// ...
def compute(i: Int)(config: Config): String = ???
def show(str: String)(config: Config): Unit = ???
```

We may want to combine `compute` and `show` into a single function, accepting a `Config` as parameter, and showing the result of the computation.
If we had a `flatMap` function as in the examples above, we would be able to write the following:

```scala
def computeAndShow(i: Int): Config => Unit = compute(i).flatMap(show)
```

Let's define this `Monad` then. First, we are going to define a type named `ConfigDependent` representing a function that when passed a `Config` produces a `Result`.

```scala
trait Config // the Config defined above
type ConfigDependent[Result] = Config => Result
```

The monad will look like this:

```scala
given configDependentMonad as Monad[ConfigDependent] {
  def [A, B](r: ConfigDependent[A]).flatMap(f: A => ConfigDependent[B]): ConfigDependent[B] =
    config => f(r(config))(config)
  def pure[A](x: A): ConfigDependent[A] =
    config => x
}
```

The type `ConfigDependent` can be written using [type lambdas](../new-types/type-lambdas.html):

```scala
type ConfigDependent = [Result] =>> Config => Result
```

Using this syntax would turn the previous `configReaderMonad` into:


```scala
given configDependentMonad as Monad[[Result] =>> Config => Result]
  def [A, B](r: Config => A).flatMap(f: A => Config => B): Config => B =
    config => f(r(config))(config)
  def pure[A](x: A): Config => A =
    config => x
```



It is likely that we would like to use this pattern with other kinds of environments than our `Config` trait. The Reader monad allows us to abstract away `Config` as a type _parameter_, named `Ctx` in the following definition:

```scala
given readerMonad[Ctx] as Monad[[X] =>> Ctx => X] {
  def [A, B](r: Ctx => A).flatMap(f: A => Ctx => B): Ctx => B =
    ctx => f(r(ctx))(ctx)
  def pure[A](x: A): Ctx => A =
    ctx => x
}
```

### Summary

The definition of a _typeclass_ is expressed via a parameterised type with abstract members, such as a `trait`.
The main difference between object oriented polymorphism, and ad-hoc polymorphism with _typeclasses_, is how the definition of the _typeclass_ is implemented, in relation to the type it acts upon.
In the case of a _typeclass_, its implementation for a concrete type is expressed through a `given` term definition, which is supplied as an implicit argument alongside the value it acts upon. With object oriented polymorphism, the implementation is mixed into the parents of a class, and only a single term is required to perform a polymorphic operation.

To conclude, in addition to given instances, other constructs like extension methods, context bounds and type lambdas allow a concise and natural expression of _typeclasses_.
