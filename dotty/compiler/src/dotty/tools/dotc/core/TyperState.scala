   *  1) Typecheck argument in typerstate 1.

   *  3) Evolve same typer state (to typecheck other arguments, say)
   *     leading to a different constraint.
   *  4) Take typechecked argument in same state.

   * isApplicableSafe but also for (e.g. erased-lubs.scala) as well as
   * many parts of dotty itself.
